# üì¶ Stock-Report-Using-Power-BI

* In this project, I developed an **interactive Power BI Stock Report** using the **Stock Report** dataset to uncover key inventory and stock-related insights.  
* As part of the dashboard-building process, I performed the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** steps using **Power Query** to clean and shape the data.  
* I used **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures essential for inventory analysis.  
* After completing the calculations, I designed visualizations using **cards, charts, slicers**, and other Power BI components to build an intuitive and informative report.  
* The dashboard helps end-users easily interpret stock trends and make data-driven decisions.
